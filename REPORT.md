# Lab 1 Git Race -- Project Report
# David Borrel Seral -- 871643

## Description of Changes

### 1. Time-based Greeting
- Implemented a greeting system that adapts messages based on the time of day:
  - "Good Morning" (before 12:00)
  - "Good Afternoon" (12:00–18:00)
  - "Good Evening" (after 18:00)
- This feature makes the user experience more natural and personalized.

### 2. Caching
- Integrated Spring Boot's caching abstraction with `@EnableCaching` and `@Cacheable`.
- Cached API responses for the same input name to improve performance and avoid recalculating repeated greetings.

### 3. Logging
- Added structured logging using Spring Boot’s default logging system (Logback).
- Structured logs make it easier to debug and find mistakes.

## Technical Decisions
- Selected Spring Boot's built-in caching abstraction for simplicity and flexibility.
- Adopted structured logging to facilitate log aggregation and monitoring in production environments.
- Make tests for every implementation to ensure that the system continues working correctly.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learn how the Java Spring Boot framework works.
- Learn to analyze a project to understand it correctly before adding new features.
- I improved my ability to use **Git** correctly for version control and collaborative development.
- After this small project, i feel more confident building, testing, and documenting modern web applications.

## AI Disclosure
### AI Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot
- Claude Sonnet 3.7
- GitHub ChatGPT 4.1

### AI-Assisted Work
- Most of the code is designed by me, AI has been used to get some initial ideas, help with some syntax formatting and to fix gradlew errors
- It's hard to calculate this, but I would say:  **~20% AI-assisted, ~80% original work**.
- All code generated by the AI ​​is reviewed to adapt it to the conventions and guidelines learned by the developer. Additionally, if a code fragment is not understood by the developer, i search another way to implement it.

### Original Work
-  The majority of the implementations (time-based greeting, integration of caching, logging) was designed and coded by me.
- The documentation and tests was all implemented by me, with some help from AI.
- This project has helped me to better understand how web servers work. It has also helped me learn about the Java Spring Boot framework. Additionaly, it has been very helpful in continuing to learn good practices in the use of Git. Finally, the use of AI is also a challenge; one must be cautious with it and use it very responsibly."
